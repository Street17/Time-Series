Hi folks!

Here I have shown with implementation how and when to use single exponential smoothing (SES), double exponential smoothing (DES) and triple exponential smoothing (TES) technique of time series. I have used different dataset to demonstrate each technique.  

Required codes and data set are attached through which you can reproduce my results. Happy learning :)
