Hi folks!

In this series I have tried my best to demonstrate how and when to use single exponential smoothing (SES), double exponential smoothing (DES) and triple exponential smoothing (TES) technique of time series with data. I have used different dataset to demonstrate each technique.  

Required codes and data set are attached through which you can reproduce my results. Happy learning :)
